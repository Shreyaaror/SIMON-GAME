# SIMON-GAME
The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where the player must repeat an ever-increasing sequence of colors. The game starts with one random color, and with each correct round, it adds a new one to the sequence. The playerâ€™s goal is to recall and repeat the pattern correctly. One wrong move and it's game over!
